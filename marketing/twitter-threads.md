🥇 1. CURSOR
The AI-first IDE that replaced VS Code for me.

🥉 3. CLAUDE 3.5
When you need to understand HUGE codebases.

• Documentation generation
• Complex architectural decisions

4. WINDSURF by @codeiumdev

The first truly "agentic" IDE.

Instead of autocomplete, it:
• Plans multi-step changes
• Executes across files
• Asks for confirmation

Game changer for large refactors.

5. SUPERMAVEN

Fastest autocomplete I've ever used.

1M token context window means it remembers EVERYTHING from your project.

Latency is nearly instant.

Best for: Speed demons

My personal AI stack:

• Cursor (daily coding)
• Claude (architecture & docs)
• Linear (project management)
• Notion AI (documentation)

What's yours? 👇

트윗 9/10
One thing I learned:

Don't use AI to replace thinking.
Use it to accelerate implementation.

The best devs I know use AI for:
• Boilerplate
• Documentation  
• Testing
• Refactoring

Not for:
• Architecture decisions
• Complex algorithms
• Security-critical code
